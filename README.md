# Langevin-equation-solver
A python code to solve Langevin equation for arbitrary potentials, Parallel replica notebook uses the parallel replica method as means of accelerating the rate calculations. The results from the langevin.ipynb notebook are verified by reproducing results from https://www3.mpibpc.mpg.de/groups/de_groot/compbio2/p9/index.html
